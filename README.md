# Portfolio Optimization Tool 

This Python-based Portfolio Optimization Tool leverages both Neural Network and Monte Carlo simulation techniques to assist investors in optimizing their investment portfolios. The tool allows users to input historical stock data, and it provides optimized portfolio weights based on predictive models. The Neural Network model utilizes a deep learning architecture to forecast future returns, while the Monte Carlo simulation optimizes portfolios for risk and return. The graphical user interface (GUI) simplifies the process, making portfolio optimization accessible to both beginners and experienced investors.

Key Features:
Neural Network Optimization: Utilizes deep learning to predict future stock returns.
Monte Carlo Simulation: Performs simulations for optimal risk and return portfolios.
